# Solar Panel Installation System

India is a leading country in the production of renewable solar energy. There are two types of solar panels available in the Indian market, namely monocrystalline and polycrystalline solar panels, which are installed on rooftops. Both types of panels are available for domestic and commercial use. The installation charges for monocrystalline panels are around 40,000, and for polycrystalline panels, around 60,000. The warranty period for monocrystalline panels is 15 years, and for polycrystalline panels, it is 25 years from the date of installation. Each panel is identified by a unique photovoltaic module (PV module).

These panels are installed for both domestic (houses) and commercial (offices, hotels, hostels, etc.) use. The installations are carried out by authorized vendors who are also the distributors of the panels. The vendors or distributors are identified by their unique TIN number, name, address, and contact details. The users are identified by their house or office numbers and address. The capacity of the panels depends on the number of members at the installation site. Therefore, there can be multiple panel installations from different vendors at the same location.
